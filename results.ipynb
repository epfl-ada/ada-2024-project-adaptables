If we look only at the percentage of award winning comedies over the total number of award winning movies per country to find where the best comedies are made, we find some surprising results. Some countries like Slovenia, Azerbaijan, Zimbabwe, Bosnia and Herzegovina have a 100% result which means that every oscar winning by movies in these countries are from comedies. However when we look at the second graph we can understand that those countries have such a high score because they only won one Oscar and it happened to be a comedy. We can contrast the precedent result by looking at the tradeoff between the number of movies critically acclaimed and the percentage of them that are comedies, in this case Ireland looks like a good destination for finding a well critically received comedy !"
