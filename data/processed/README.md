# Pre-processed data

This folder contains some of the pre-processed data.
Use the table hereunder to find, for each file in this directory, which of the python scripts under `src/scripts` was used to generate the data file, if you would want to recreate it yourself.
Most of these are loaded in the global `ExtraDatasetInfo` object (see `src/utils/data_utils.py`).
As mentioned in the main README, you can fin all the files [here](https://go.epfl.ch/adaptables_extra_files). Simply extract it (`unzip extra_files.zip`) inside the root directory (***not*** in here), and all the files will place themselves correctly (here).
