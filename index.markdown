## Act 1: The Mystery Unfolds

"Welcome to the Comedy Conspiracy, where we investigate the secret ingredients of cinematic laughter. Some say it’s all about the plot. Others claim it’s the actors or the timing of the release. But what if it’s a combination of things we’ve never considered? Our first clue lies in the numbers."

### Act 1, Scene 1: The Sentiment Sleuths

GRAPHE1

CARTOON1

The correlation between the sentiment analysis mean scores and the ratings of the user is quite low (<0.4) and does not permit drawing conclusions on the accuracy of these factors to validate if a movie is ‘good’. Indeed, low correlation value and high spreading of the points show that a rating does not necessarily reflect the sentiment transmitted by the review. A bias that could have been expected would be to observe more positive sentiment for comedies than for other types of movies. Even though the 2 groups are significantly different, statistically speaking, comedies do not display much higher sentiment scores than other types of movies.

**Detective:** “So you’re telling me people’s feelings don’t always match the stars they give? The correlation’s barely scratching 0.4. That’s... fishy.” 


While comedies are generally thought to spread joy, sentiment analysis shows their emotional impact isn’t much higher than other genres. A low correlation between ratings and sentiment tells us that being “happy” doesn’t guarantee being “good.”

## Act 2: The Case of the Missing Awards

**Narrator:** "Comedies rarely walk the red carpet, but why? Our next stop takes us to the glamorous world of Oscars and critical acclaim." 

### Act 2, Scene 1: The Award Alibi

GRAPH3

**Analyst:** “Look at this—100% of Oscar-winning films from Slovenia are comedies. Impressive, until you realize… they’ve only won one Oscar.”

To uncover which countries produce the most critically acclaimed comedies, we analyzed Oscar nominations and wins. By calculating the percentage of Oscar-winning comedies out of all award-winning films from each country, we uncovered some unexpected insights.
Countries like Slovenia, Azerbaijan, Zimbabwe, and Bosnia and Herzegovina boast a 100% success rate for comedies—every Oscar-winning film from these nations is a comedy. However, a deeper look at the data reveals that these perfect scores come from a single Oscar win in each country, which happened to be for a comedy.

To get a more balanced perspective, we examined the tradeoff between the total number of critically acclaimed films and the percentage that are comedies. This reveals Ireland as a standout destination for finding high-quality, critically praised comedies.

**Detective:** "So Ireland’s got the goods. But what about the rest of the world? Time to follow the money."
