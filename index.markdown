# What Makes a Great Comedy?

Laughter. This great human sentiment that surrounds us from a very early age is a crucial aspect of cinematography and even has its own genre associated – comedies. Do you remember chuckling at the latest *Hangover*? Do you also remember being bored when watching *The Emoji Movie*?
