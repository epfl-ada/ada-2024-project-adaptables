## Act 1: The Mystery Unfolds

"Welcome to the Comedy Conspiracy, where we investigate the secret ingredients of cinematic laughter. Some say it’s all about the plot. Others claim it’s the actors or the timing of the release. But what if it’s a combination of things we’ve never considered? Our first clue lies in the numbers."

### Act 1, Scene 1: The Sentiment Sleuths

CARTOON1

GRAPHE1

The correlation between the sentiment analysis mean scores and the ratings of the user is quite low (<0.4) and does not permit drawing conclusions on the accuracy of these factors to validate if a movie is ‘good’. Indeed, low correlation value and high spreading of the points show that a rating does not necessarily reflect the sentiment transmitted by the review. A bias that could have been expected would be to observe more positive sentiment for comedies than for other types of movies. Even though the 2 groups are significantly different, statistically speaking, comedies do not display much higher sentiment scores than other types of movies.

GRAPHE2

**Detective:** “So you’re telling me people’s feelings don’t always match the stars they give? The correlation’s barely scratching 0.4. That’s... fishy.” 


While comedies are generally thought to spread joy, sentiment analysis shows their emotional impact isn’t much higher than other genres. A low correlation between ratings and sentiment tells us that being “happy” doesn’t guarantee being “good.”

## Act 2: The Case of the Missing Awards

ILLUSTRATION2

**Narrator:** "Comedies rarely walk the red carpet, but why? Our next stop takes us to the glamorous world of Oscars and critical acclaim." 

### Act 2, Scene 1: The Award Alibi

GRAPH3

**Analyst:** “Look at this—100% of Oscar-winning films from Slovenia are comedies. Impressive, until you realize… they’ve only won one Oscar.”

To uncover which countries produce the most critically acclaimed comedies, we analyzed Oscar nominations and wins. By calculating the percentage of Oscar-winning comedies out of all award-winning films from each country, we uncovered some unexpected insights.
Countries like Slovenia, Azerbaijan, Zimbabwe, and Bosnia and Herzegovina boast a 100% success rate for comedies—every Oscar-winning film from these nations is a comedy. However, a deeper look at the data reveals that these perfect scores come from a single Oscar win in each country, which happened to be for a comedy.

To get a more balanced perspective, we examined the tradeoff between the total number of critically acclaimed films and the percentage that are comedies. This reveals Ireland as a standout destination for finding high-quality, critically praised comedies.

**Detective:** "So Ireland’s got the goods. But what about the rest of the world? Time to follow the money."

## Act 3: The Measure of Success

**Narrator:** "When it comes to comedy, the money trail doesn’t lie. But it tells a story of its own."

### Act 3, Scene 1: The Box Office Break-In

GRAPH4

**Analyst:** “The USA dominates in absolute dollars, but Serbia’s punching above its weight in comedy percentages. Small fish, big laughs.”

Comedy consistently contributes to box office revenues across countries, with some nations showing particularly strong reliance on this genre.Even though comedies revenues represent a smaller percentage of the United States box office revenues than Serbia or Montenegro, in absolute value  it is still more profitable to make a comedy in the USA, since the United State of America produces such an important part of the movies.

Despite differences in scale, one thing is clear: comedy consistently contributes to box office success worldwide. But financial triumph doesn’t always align with critical acclaim. The team devises a “Popularity Score” to crack the code.

**Detective:** "Indeed the money is important, but in order to measure the success of a comedy shouldn’t we also look at its popularity?"

**Narrator:** "With the bigger picture in focus, we dive into the finer details. What makes audiences laugh, and why does it work?"

### Act 4, Scene 1: The Genre & Topics Investigation

**Narrator:** "Throughout the age of cinema the trends have evolved, we need to be up to date with the comedy movie landscape in order to make the best of the situation."

We can see the evolution of the genres that can be found in comedy movies throughout the decades. The variety of genres associated with comedies have not stopped growing since the Hollywood golden age, while some genres are always well represented throughout the year such as comedy-drama there are some newcomers for example the 2010’s have seen the emergence of the Horror comedy genre.

**Analyst:** “Apparently the sector did not wait for our analysis to put an emphasis on romance-comedy movies, they always have been classics and stay classics.”

**Detective:** “Genres evolve with the times and place. What worked in the ‘90s doesn’t always land today. In what environment do they evolve better?  You always need to learn and adapt from your environment.”

GRAPH11

The success of comedy genres varies significantly based on the cultural and regional context in which a movie is produced. For instance, if we aim to produce a successful comedy in the USA, a romantic comedy would maximize our chances of success. Conversely, in France, a comedy-drama would be the ideal choice, it certainly aligns better with the tastes of the French viewers. Understanding these regional nuances is crucial for tailoring comedic elements to the audience's cultural expectations.

**Detective:** "Comedy is a chameleon—it changes its colors depending on where it’s born. In the U.S., love gets the laughs, but in France, it’s the drama that seals the deal."
